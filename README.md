# Breast-Cancer-Classification-in-R

 Implemented various Machine Learning algorithms for an open-source dataset of Breast Cancer: For classification, the types of cancer benign and malignant.
 Compared the accuracies of those algorithms that helped to identify the best Machine Learning model. The best model obtained was with an accuracy of 98.9% using the SVM tuned algorithm.
